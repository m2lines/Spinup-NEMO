# Define the Dimentionality Technique class and the Forecast Technique class somewhere in seperate files in the project
# These should take in input in a standard form and return the output in a standard form
# The content/techniques used and implementation is not important, just that the input and output is in a standard form
# The classes should be able to be used in the following way:
# - They can be imported and called in the forecast.py file
# - The user only needs to change the two files to change the technique used and given that the input and output is in a standard form
#   the user should not need to change the forecast.py file
# If multiple techniques are used, the user should be able to choose which technique to use in the forecast.py file by way of changing a variable
# This should later be done by way of a config file

# Specifically the defining of the GP should not be done in the Prediction contructor

# First refactor the forecast.py file to use the classes while still using PCA and the GP
